=================
Manage resources implicitly
No need for developer to close resources explicitly

DiamondOperator <>

Simplifies coding
Compiler infers the data type

 * code is verbose and complex code
 * methods not consistent with all operating system
 Missing basic file operations
 Limited support for file attribute

G1 Garbage Collector
==================
Introduced in java7

G1 stands for Garbage First
G1 Garbage collector performs cleanup first in the region where there is more garbage.
G1 garbage collector performance is better compared to older version.
Before java7
------------
Garbage collector divides Java heap memory into three regions
1. Young/Eden space
2. Old
3. Permgen/Permanent
For each region there is space allocated/reserved

Garbage collector divides Java Heap memory into multiple regions/blocks
The size of each block/region is equal
The size of these blocks can be configured and varies between 1 and 32 MB.
