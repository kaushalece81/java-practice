JLINK
Why custom JRE
1. suppose your application contains only 5 java files
2. To run this small application, we need to install complete JRE which contains hundreds of classes.
default size of JRE 189mb which huge

Problem with defualt JRE
1. Memory wastage
2. Default JRE is not recommended for small devices and IOT devices
3. Java was not the best choice for small devicesuntil java8
